Authors: Nissim DJERROUDI & Vo Thi Quynh Yen ( @ndjerrou - @themonster2015)

Description: This project intends to reproduce an article from the New York Times while using HTML & CSS.
Method used: We used flexbox together with other CSS properties to position and align the elements.
Possible improvement: make it mobile-responsive.

The project is live at [NYT Clone](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ndjerrou/NYTimes_Clone/cecedd746e5ef5ce1749f0d1235528e6c4179bd5/index.html)
